# Analysis

To develop the dashboard, the following data points and KPIs will be analyzed:

Total Calls Answered vs. Abandoned: Understanding customer reachability.
Calls by Time Intervals: Identifying peak hours for better resource allocation.
Average Speed of Answer: Evaluating customer wait time.

b) Customer Satisfaction

Satisfaction Score Trends: Tracking overall customer feedback.
Call Resolution Rate: Measuring first-call resolution success.

c) Agent Performance Analysis

Agent’s Performance Quadrant:

The Power BI dashboard will incorporate interactive visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, and heat maps to highlight patterns and support decision-making.
